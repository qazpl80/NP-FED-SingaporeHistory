            <h2>Improvement To The Economy</h2>
            <p>
                Despite the failure of the merger,Lee Kuan Yew continued to make clear decisions to
                improve Singapore's current status, his most important task was to fix the high unemployment of
                rate of Singapore. After several attempts of providing jobs for the public, he was finally
                able to increase the economy by attracting foreign investments from multinational
                corporations. By the 1970s, Singapore had become a major electronics exporter with
                the help of multinational corporations such as Texas Instruments & Hewlett-Packard
                setting their foundations in Singapore.

            <h3>Tackling The Security of The Nation</h3>
            <p>
                Singapore's vulnerability was felt throughout the nation, with threats from the communists
                & Indonesia about their combative capabilities as a nation. Lee quickly sought
                for international recognition of Singapore's Isdependence as Singapore had gained
                admission to the United Nations. He requested help from Israel & Taiwan for advice on
                training & appointed Gok Keng Swee. In 1967, Lee introduced the concept of National Service
                where all able-bodied male Singaporean citizens age 18 & above have to serve National
                Service either in the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Police Force or the Singapore Civil
                Defense. By 1971, Singapore had 17 national service battalions (16,000 men) with 14 battalions
                (11,000 men) in the reserves.

            <h4>Corruption in Singapore</h4>
            <p>
                Lee introduced legislation giving the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) greater
                power to conduct arrests, search, call up witnesses & investigate bank accounts & income-tax
                returns of suspected persons and their families. On 21 November 1986, He received a complaint
                of corruption against Teh Cheang Wan who was Minister for National Development at the time.
                As Lee was against corruption, he allowed the CPIB to carry out investigations on Teh but
                Teh committed suicide before he could face the consequences of his actions.
