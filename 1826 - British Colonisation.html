                        The shorter travelling time, along with other factors such as the greater usage of steamers rather than sailing ships, led to an increase in trade between Europe and Asia.<br /> This development could be seen in Singapore’s trade figures: total trade volume reached $71 million in 1870, a year after the canal was opened, up from only $39 million the year before. The trade boom would continue throughout the 1870s, and by 1879, the colony’s total trade volume was valued at $105 million.<br />

                        <b>1922 - Singapore becomes main British naval base in East Asia.</b><br />
                        After the Great War, the British government devoted significant resources into building a naval base in Singapore, as a deterrent to the increasingly ambitious Japanese Empire.<br />
                        Originally announced in 1923, the construction of the base proceeded slowly at Sembawang until the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931.<br />
                        It was completed in 1938, at a staggering cost of £60 million – equivalent to £2½ billion in 2006. <br />
                        The base covered 21 square miles (54 km2) and had what was then the largest dry dock in the world, the third-largest floating dock, and enough fuel tanks to support the entire British Navy for six months.<br />
                        Today, the shipyard is known as Sembcorp Marine Ltd, the marine services arm of Sembcorp Industries.
