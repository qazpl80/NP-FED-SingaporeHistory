                <h1>1965 - Independence</h1>
                <p>
                    From 1963 - 1965, Malaya, Singapore, North Borneo and Sarawak were merged and Malaysia was formed.
                    This is due to the limited resources avaliable in Singapore  and People’s Action Party (PAP) needed the merger to secure its political legitimacy.
                    However, this merger does not last long as racial tension in Singapore increases due to the discriminatory policies imposed by the malays while Lee Kuan Yew and other political leaders prefer a fairer treatment among all races.
                    The differences in opinion and the tension causes the seperation to occur and Singapore became independent in 1965. The  <br /><br />
                    From the sudden independence of Singapore, the path Singapore have to went through were met with multiple challenges and problems. Singapore Economic Development Board developed
                    policies and strategies to promote manufacturing and attract foreign investments. Furthermore, Singapore invested heavily in education and set English as a primary language.
                    Unfortunately, as Singapore is slowly trying to resolve the problems, a fire broke out due to the large amount of squatters and poor public housing resulting in 4 death and
                    leaving 16,000 people homeless. This fire is also known as the "Bukit Ho Swee Fire". After the incident, Singapore's Housing Developement Board began to began huge projects to
                    provide an affordable housing to the squatters affected by the fire. The british troop continue to stay in Singapore until 1968, where they announce the withdrawal of forces by 1971.
                    Luckily, Singapore Armed Forces is established rapidly and the introduce of National Service in 1967 allows Singapore to protect itself without the help of the british troop.<br /><br />
                    From 1980 - 1990, Singapore rapidly develop from a third-world country to a first-world country with unemployment rate falling to 3% and Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) started operation
                    in 1987.
