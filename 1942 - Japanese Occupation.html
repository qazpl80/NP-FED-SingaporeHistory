                    In order to remove Western influence, the Japanese set up schools to teach the people the Japanese language. Textbooks were printed in Japanese. Every morning, the children had to stand facing the direction of Japan and sing the Japanese national anthem.

                    In the cinemas, only Japanese movies and propaganda films were shown. These films showed the virtues of the Japanese and made fun of the British. Going to the cinemas had its dangers too since the Japanese might suddenly appear and take away young men to work on the Death Railway. Sometimes, the Japanese would plant themselves in the cinemas and would listen secretly to conversations, hoping to overhear anti-Japanese remarks.

                    The local Chinese and English newspapers had very little local news. Most of what was reported was the Japanese version of the war and pro-Japanese speeches. Radio stations were controlled by the Japanese and radio owners could listen only to local broadcasts. Tuning in to foreign broadcasting stations was done at great risk. Those caught doing so were severely punished or even killed.

                    The Kempeitai was Japan’s military police force in its occupied territories during World War II (1942–45). Specially trained in interrogation methods, the Kempeitai’s task was to crush all resistance to Japanese military rule, with the powers to arrest and extract information from civilians as well as military personnel.
                    Its main responsibility then was to discipline army officers and farmers who opposed the conscription law. Its powers were later extended to the enforcement of Japan’s various security laws under the Acts of 1898 and 1928.
                    As a semi-autonomous unit attached to the army and accountable to the war minister, the Kempeitai was responsible for ensuring military discipline; gathering intelligence and carrying out subversion work; maintaining law and order; and policing thoughts in the civilian populations of Japanese-occupied territories. Kempeitai field units accompanied the army, and were responsible for the discipline of troops and for mopping up anti-Japanese elements in the civilian populations. The Kempeitai was known for its brutality and the indiscriminate arrests of people with no or little evidence. Confessions were commonly obtained through various torture methods with no proper trials. Many captives died during torture and under harsh living conditions.

                        The Kempeitai,the Japanese Military Police  , which was the dominant occupation unit in Singapore, committed numerous atrocities towards the common people. They introduced the system of "Sook Ching", meaning "purging through purification" in Chinese, to get rid of those, especially so ethnic Chinese, deemed to be hostile to the Empire of Japan.
                        For 14 days between 18 February to 4 March 1942, all Chinese males aged 18-50 were ordered to report to screening Centers across the country. The Japanese occupiers were intentional in their efforts to root out any and all resistance within the Chinese community. By the most arbitrary means at their disposal, the Japanese began weeding out the potential troublemakers – often without any evidence. Hooded informants would point out the individuals who were involved in “anti Japanese activities” or who had contributed to the war effort in China. Individuals who “failed” the screening process were loaded onto trucks, driven to remote locations across Singapore and summarily executed. The corpses would then be buried in mass graves, hidden out of sight from the rest of the population.

                        The secrecy of the killings meant the families of the victims had no knowledge of their loved ones’ deaths till after the war when the mass graves were dug up. Conservative estimates put the death toll of the Sook Ching Massacre at 25,000. That figure represents approximately 3.14% of the total population of 795,000 at the time. Higher estimates of 40,000 dead would put that figure at approximately 5.03%. The rate at which people were being killed was exceptionally high, given the short amount of time the Japanese took to execute Sook Ching. It was slaughter at an industrial scale and it forever altered the landscape, society and destiny of Singapore.
                        Even after 75 years, the legacy of the Sook Ching Massacre is still being felt in one way or another. Almost every Chinese household that traces its roots to pre WW2 Singapore has lost at least one member of the family. The brutality of the massacre and Japanese subjugation sparked a political awakening in the local Chinese community. After the war, more individuals became actively involved in pro independence, anti colonialist movements. It was from the bloodshed of WW2 and left wing revolutionary fervour in the immediate post war years that the PAP was first founded. The disproportionate rate at which the Chinese were singled out for acts of brutality widened the rift between the Chinese and Malay community. These tensions would be played out on the streets during the racial riots of 1964, nearly 2 decades after the end of WW2. The painful memories of occupation was the primary motivation for the Pioneer leaders of Singapore prioritise national defence to guard Singapore’s sovereignty. Till this day, all male Singaporeans have to serve 2 years of National Service in the SAF or SCDF. Few events in our past have left such a profound impact on our culture and society.

                        The Sook Ching Massacre remains one of the darkest chapters in Singapore’s history. Looking back at the events of 1942, one can’t help but to bemoan and lament the tens of thousands of lives that were cut short. They were fathers, brothers, uncles, sons, Neighbours, friends – real people with real stories. Their deaths left a void in society that remained long after the war ended.
