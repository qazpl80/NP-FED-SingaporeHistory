                <p>
                    From 1963 - 1965, Malaya, Singapore, North Borneo and Sarawak were merged and Malaysia was formed.
                    This is due to the limited resources avaliable in Singapore  and People’s Action Party (PAP) needed the merger to secure its political legitimacy.
                    However, this merger does not last long as racial tension in Singapore increases due to the discriminatory policies imposed by the malays while Lee Kuan Yew and other political leaders prefer a fairer treatment among all races.
                    The differences in opinion and the tension causes the seperation to occur and Singapore became independent in 1965. The  <br /><br />

                <p>
                    From the sudden independence of Singapore, the path Singapore have to went through were met with multiple challenges and problems. Singapore Economic Development Board developed
                    policies and strategies to promote manufacturing and attract foreign investments. Furthermore, Singapore invested heavily in education and set English as a primary language.
                    Unfortunately, as Singapore is slowly trying to resolve the problems, a fire broke out due to the large amount of squatters and poor public housing resulting in 4 death and
                    leaving 16,000 people homeless. This fire is also known as the "Bukit Ho Swee Fire". After the incident, Singapore's Housing Developement Board began to began huge projects to
                    provide an affordable housing to the squatters affected by the fire.

                    <h2 class="independence-h2">Singapore Armed Forces</h2>
                    The british troop continue to stay in Singapore until 1968, where they announce the withdrawal of forces by 1971.
                    Luckily, Singapore Armed Forces is established rapidly and the introduce of National Service in 1967 allows Singapore to protect itself without the help of the british troop.
                    National Service (NS) requires all male citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents to register upon reaching the age of 16.5 years old. However, many chinese middle school
                    students and their parent who did not see the need to support the British colonial government’s military efforts lead to protest and violence. Some of the chinese middle
                    school student who feel that the british has discriminate them and refuse to register (which is illegal that can result in six month jail term, a fine of 2,000 Malayan
                    dollars or both).<br /><br />

                <p>
                    From 1980 - 1990, Singapore rapidly develop from a third-world country to a first-world country with unemployment rate falling to 3%. However, Singapore have to compete
                    with neighboring countries who sold similar goods at lower prices.Luckily, a more educated workforce help Singapore greatly in terms of upgrading its industries
                    to higher-technology industries. Lastly. Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) started operation in 1987 to counter the problem of traffic congestion and allow much more convenience in
                    travelling around Singapore.
